Three JS powered Tower Defense
===================

A long long time ago, in a place far beyond our time, was a world that was not like ours. Things where simple and basic. Logic ruled and there was order...

After the creation of stars and planets a new force came to existence and entered the world of order. Chaos follewed and structure became fragile. Are you able to keep things simple?

This is a space-like tower defense game build with the THREE JS Framework.
